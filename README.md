# heroku-wtf

Sometimes, you just want to gripe.

## usage

    $ heroku wtf "I am so confused!"

## what it does

This posts your username and an optional single-argument "vent" to a small `heroku-wtf` service which @pvh monitors.

# installation

    $ heroku plugins:install http://github.com/pvh/heroku-wtf

## this is obviously not an official heroku project

but i will read your gripes and may even be able to help from time to time.

enjoy!
